## What The Forge Does

Your backpackâ€™s overflowing, duplicates are piling up, and that perfect roll still wonâ€™t drop. Enter The Forge: feed it three copies of an item and it spits out one tougher, shinier version. Finally, progress without the grind.

## How it works

- Tap the anvil icon in the "Allocate Stats" screen.
- Tap three items with identical tier and raritiy.
- Hit "Forge Equipment" â€“ boom, upgraded loot.

## ðŸ”§ Behind the Scenes (Dev Diary)

The initial release (v2.6.0) featuring The Forge had a bug - but thanks to a Reddit user who reported it, the issue causing the game to break was quickly identified and fixed.

  If you put itens [sic, should be "items"] from different grades or rarities, the game crashes and all itens [sic] will disappear, breaking the game!
