The latest patch introduces the **Bestiary**, a handy in-game log that records each monster you face. Encounter a new foe and it is added to the list with an image. Rack up kills to see your totals climb.

You can see a preview of the feature in [this Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/QuickDungeonCrawler/comments/1lwsews/update_270_bestiary/).

Under the hood the system stores data in `localStorage` and uses [bestiary.js](https://github.com/Werkstattl/quick-dungeon-crawler-rpg-od/blob/main/assets/js/bestiary.js) to build the list. Each enemy name maps to a sprite and keeps track of encounter and kill counts.

Give it a try and start filling out your monster compendium!
