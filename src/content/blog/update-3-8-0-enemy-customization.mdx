Update 3.8.0 is live and brings a big bestiary upgrade with more control over how enemies look and appear.

## Highlights

- Added **enemy customization** (unlockable as an in-app purchase), including custom names and custom images in the bestiary.
- Added **bestiary sorting options** to make it easier to find specific enemies.
- Added a **Stats help link** with quick descriptions for each stat.
- Added a setting so **auto mode can keep running during level-up screens** (or stop there if you prefer).
- Added an **inventory lock option** so selected gear is protected during mass sell.
- Added clearer stat feedback by showing the **current value even above cap**.

## Smaller improvements and fixes

- Improved bestiary image handling (normalization/format support) for more reliable custom enemy images.
- Updated some dungeon/combat log text and shipped additional UI polish/bug fixes.

Thank you for all the feedback and ideas — they helped shape this update.
