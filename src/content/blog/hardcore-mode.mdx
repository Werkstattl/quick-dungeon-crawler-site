Version 2.7.4 introduces a **Hardcore Mode** that you can toggle while creating a new hero. When enabled, any time your hero dies, all of their gold and inventory disappear. It's a high risk, high reward challenge for players looking to test their skills.

Hardcore Mode was requested on [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/QuickDungeonCrawler/comments/1m10vii/is_there_a_version_of_this_that_resets_the_gold/) and I'm happy to see people challenge their friends with it. 

Did you know Quick Dungeon Crawler already supports importing and exporting save files? If you want to preserve a favorite character before diving into Hardcore Mode, you can export their data first.

There's also a safeguard when you enable Hardcore while an existing save is detected. The game warns you so you don't accidentally lose progress. You can see the [commit implementing the warning](https://github.com/Werkstattl/quick-dungeon-crawler-rpg-od/commit/d70afda06b1d0a693db264a72384628acabaa55a) for more details.

Give Hardcore Mode a spin and let me know how long you survive!
