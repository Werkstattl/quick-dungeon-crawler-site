Version 2.9.0 introduces a few notable gameplay tweaks. First, **enemies now have a chance to dodge** your attacks just like you can dodge theirs. The dodge chance varies by monster type, so stay alert.

The **Bestiary save system** was migrated to IndexedDB for better reliability. This change unfortunately wipes your existing bestiary entries.

Your hero's **inventory and combat log now have limits** so things stay manageable. The mysterious chamber event was also removed.
