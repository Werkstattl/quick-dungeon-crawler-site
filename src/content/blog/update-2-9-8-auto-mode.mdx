Version 2.9.8 is here, and it brings a much-requested feature is kinda ready for prime time: **Auto Mode**!

For those who prefer a more hands-off approach, you can now enable Auto Mode. When active, the game will automatically handle dungeon events for you, accepting or declining them as they come. This is perfect for when you want to keep making progress while your attention is elsewhere.

This feature is very new, so we welcome your feedback to help us improve it. We've already implemented enhancements like auto-claiming items more complex logic for doors.

Additionally, this update includes some adjustments to our itch.io release. You can buy the game there and get all premium features available on Windows, Android and Mac.
