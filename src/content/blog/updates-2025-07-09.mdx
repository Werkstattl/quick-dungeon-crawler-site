Quick Dungeon Crawler has been steadily updated over the first week of July. Here are the notable changes since June 30:

## New Features

- **Rate Game Button** – a new menu option lets you quickly leave a rating for the game.
- **Auto-Equip** – equipment now auto-equips when gear is forged or looted until the player has a full set of gear.
- **Title Menu** – the title screen now also shows a menu button.
- **Docker Support** – Dockerfile and documentation were added for running the game in a container.
- **Local PHP Server Option** – README updates show how to run a PHP server for local testing.

## Improvements & Fixes

- Combat sounds mute and background music pauses when the app loses focus without "Paused" being displayed.
- Healing shrine prompts use shorter text.
- Several tweaks to dungeon events: removed outdated messages about resting and HP regeneration, adjusted resting and player HP values, and refined forge visibility.
