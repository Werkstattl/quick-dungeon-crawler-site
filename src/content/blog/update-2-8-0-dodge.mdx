Version 2.8.0 introduces a **dodge mechanic** that lets your hero completely avoid attacks. The idea came from a player suggestion and now you can build dodge chance through gear and level-ups. Dodge is currently capped at **75%**, so there's always some risk.

Shortly after releasing 2.8.0 I noticed the **effective HP (EHP) preview gain** during levelâ€‘ups was off for it. This was fixed in 2.8.1.

You can browse the implementation details and bug fix in the [GitHub release](https://github.com/Werkstattl/quick-dungeon-crawler-rpg-od/releases/tag/2.8.2).
